<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Heat Flux DSC</li><li>Power-compensation DSC</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Differential Scanning Calorimeters (DSC) are analytical instruments used to measure the thermal properties of materials. The market is primarily segmented into two types: Heat Flux DSC and Power-compensation DSC. Heat Flux DSC operates by measuring the heat flow into or out of a sample relative to a reference, ideal for analyzing thermal transitions. In contrast, Power-compensation DSC measures the power required to maintain equal temperatures between the sample and reference, providing more precise thermal analysis, especially for specific heat capacity measurements.</p></p>
